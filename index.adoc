== About me

I am a technical writer with a passion for creating clear and concise technical documentation. With a background in Mechanical engineering, I have honed my skills in translating complex technical concepts into easily understandable content for both hardware and software products. 

Throughout my career, I have worked with various teams to develop user manuals, online help systems, and service documentation. My goal is to ensure that users have the information they need to effectively use the products and services I document.

In addition to my writing skills, I have experience in interpersonal communication and emotional intelligence, which allows me to collaborate effectively with developers, SMEs, and product managers. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my writing techniques.
